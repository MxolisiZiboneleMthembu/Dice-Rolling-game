# Dice-Rolling-game
Created a Dice game that has interface that is both creative and pleasant to the eye. 

The Dice application randomly “throws” five dice for the computer and five dice for the player. The
application displays the die values for both the computer and player.
The winner will be decided based on the following hierarchy of Die values. Any higher combination
beats a lower one; for example, five of a kind beats four of a kind; 4 of a kind beats 3 of a kind etc.
Five of a kind
Four of a kind
Three of a kind
A pair
For this game, the dice values count; for example, when both players have the same combination of
dice, the higher value wins. For example, two 6s beats two 5s.
Display whether the computer or player is the winner for each round. 
Use menus to provide the player with options to Exit the game, Help explaining the rules of the
game for new players and an About option providing information about the game developer.
